# Obsidian-workshop-part1
Obsidian cost-free text-oriented tool to enhance Teaching&amp;Leadership workflow

Obsidian's note-taking empowers academics: capturing fleeting ideas, building interconnected knowledge bases, organising research, creating mind maps, and tracking tasks, all while respecting busy schedules.
In a one-hour hands-on share-what-works-for-me workshop, we will become familiar with basic syntax on how to put it to work for work management. Bring your own laptop.

Please pre-install your Obsidian beforehand: https://help.obsidian.md/Getting+started/Download+and+install+Obsidian
